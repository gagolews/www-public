<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
Internal cluster validity measures (such as the Caliski–Harabasz, Dunn,
or Davies–Bouldin indices) are frequently used for selecting the appropriate
number of partitions a dataset should be split into. In this paper we consider
what happens if we treat such indices as objective functions in unsupervised
learning activities. Is the optimal grouping with regards to, say, the
Silhouette index really meaningful? It turns out that many cluster (in)validity
indices promote clusterings that match expert knowledge quite poorly. We also
introduce a new, well-performing variant of the Dunn index that is built upon
OWA operators and the near-neighbour graph so that subspaces of higher density,
regardless of their shapes, can be separated from each other better.</p>

<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
Effective processing of character strings is required at various
stages of data analysis pipelines: from data cleansing and preparation,
through information extraction, to report generation. Pattern searching,
string collation and sorting, normalisation, transliteration,
and formatting are ubiquitous in text mining, natural language
processing, and bioinformatics. This paper discusses and demonstrates
how and why stringi, a mature R package for fast and
portable handling of string data based on the ICU library
(International Components for Unicode), should be included in each
statistician’s or data scientist’s repertoire to complement their
numerical computing and data wrangling skills.</p>

<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
Making correct decisions as to whether code chunks should be considered
similar becomes increasingly important in software design and education
and not only can improve the quality of computer programs, but also help
assure the integrity of student assessments. In this paper we test numerous
source code similarity detection tools on pairs of code fragments written
in the data science-oriented functional programming language R. Contrary
to mainstream approaches, instead of considering symmetric measures of
“how much code chunks A and B are similar to each other”, we propose
and study the nonsymmetric degrees of inclusion “to what extent A is
a subset of B” and “to what degree B is included in A”. Overall,
t-norms yield better precision (how many suspicious pairs are actually
similar), t-conorms maximise recall (how many similar pairs are
successfully retrieved), and custom aggregation functions fitted
to training data provide a good balance between the two. Also,
we find that program dependence graph-based methods tend to outperform
those relying on normalised source code text, tokens, and names of
functions invoked.</p>

<p>English is the native language for only 5% of the World population.
Also, only 17% of us can understand this text. Moreover, the Latin alphabet
is the main one for merely 36% of the total. The early computer era, now a
very long time ago, was dominated by the US. Due to the proliferation of
the internet, smartphones, social media, and other technologies and
communication platforms, this is no longer the case.
The <a class="reference external" href="https://stringx.gagolewski.com"><em>stringx</em></a>
package replaces base R string functions (such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">grep()</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tolower()</span></code>,
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sprintf()</span></code>) with ones that fully support the Unicode standards related
to natural language processing, fixes some long-standing inconsistencies,
and introduces some new, useful features. Thanks to
<a class="reference external" href="http://site.icu-project.org">ICU</a> (International Components for Unicode) and <a class="reference external" href="https://stringi.gagolewski.com"><em>stringi</em></a>,
they are fast, reliable, and portable across different platforms.

<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
genieclust is an open source Python and R package that
implements the hierarchical clustering algorithm called Genie.
This method frequently outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches
in terms of clustering quality and speed, supports various distances over
dense, sparse, and string data domains, and can be robustified even
further with the built-in noise point detector. As domain-independent
software, it can be used for solving problems arising in all data-driven
research and development activities, including environmental, health,
biological, physical, decision, and social sciences as well as
technology and engineering. The Python version provides a
scikit-learn-compliant API, whereas the R variant is compatible with the
classic hclust(). Numerous tutorials, use cases, non-trivial examples,
documentation, installation instructions, benchmark results and timings

<p>Raul Pérez-Fernández, Bernard De Baets and I have a new
paper accepted for publication in <em>Information Fusion</em>; abstract
in the sequel.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
Compositional data naturally appear in many fields of
application. For instance, in chemistry, the relative contributions
of different chemical substances to a product are typically described
in terms of a compositional data vector.  Although the aggregation
of compositional data frequently arises in practice, the functions
formalizing this process do not fit the standard order-based
aggregation framework. This is due to the fact that there is
no intuitive order that carries the semantics of the set of
compositional data vectors (referred to as the standard simplex).
In this paper, we consider the more general betweenness-based
aggregation framework that yields a natural definition of an
aggregation function for compositional data.
The weighted centroid is proved to fit within this definition and
discussed to be linked to a very tangible interpretation. Other
functions for the aggregation of compositional data are presented
and their fit within the proposed definition is discussed.</p>

<p>To appear in <em>Fuzzy Sets and Systems</em> — a new paper
written together with Gleb Beliakov and Simon James; abstract below.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
The use of the Choquet integral in data fusion processes allows
for the effective modelling of interactions and dependencies between
data features or criteria. Its application requires identification
of the defining capacity (also known as fuzzy measure) values.
The main limiting factor is the complexity of the underlying parameter
learning problem, which grows exponentially in the number of variables.
However, in practice we may have expert knowledge regarding which of
the subsets of criteria interact with each other, and which groups are
independent. In this paper we study hierarchical aggregation processes,
architecturally similar to feed-forward neural networks, but which
allow for the simplification of the fitting problem both in terms
of the number of variables and monotonicity constraints. We note that
the Möbius representation lets us identify a number of relationships
between the overall fuzzy measure and the data pipeline structure.
Included in our findings are simplified fuzzy measures that generalise
both k-intolerant and k-interactive capacities.</p>

<p>Jan Lasek and I authored a paper that will soon appear in
<em>International Journal of Forecasting</em>, where we
introduce several new (and efficient) rating models for teams (football/soccer
in particular) based on the gradient descent algorithm.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
We introduce several new sport team rating models
based upon the gradient descent algorithm.
More precisely, the models can be formulated by maximising the
likelihood of match results observed using a single step of
this optimisation heuristic.
The framework proposed, inspired by the prominent Elo rating system,
yields an iterative version of the ordinal logistic regression
as well as different variants of the Poisson regression-based models.
This construction makes the update equations easy to interpret
as well as adjusts ratings once new match results are observed.
Thus, it naturally handles temporal changes in team strength.
Moreover, a study of association football data indicates that the
new models yield more accurate forecasts and are less computationally
demanding than
corresponding methods that jointly optimise likelihood for the whole
set of matches.</p>

This project addresses a key issue in automated decision making:
explaining how a decision was reached by a computer system to its users.
Its aim is to progress towards a new generation of explainable decision
models, which would match the performance of current black-box systems
while at the same time allow for transparency and detailed interpretation
of the underlying logic. This project expects to generate new knowledge in
modelling interdependencies of decision criteria using recent advances in
the theory of capacities. The expected outcomes are sophisticated but
tractable models in which mutual dependencies of decision rules and
criteria are treated explicitly and can be thoroughly evaluated.</p>

<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
Third-party software for assuring source code quality is becoming increasingly
popular. Tools that evaluate the coverage of unit tests,
perform static code analysis, or inspect run-time memory use
are crucial in the software development life cycle.
More sophisticated methods allow for performing meta-analyses
of large software repositories, e.g., to discover abstract topics they relate to
or common design patterns applied by their developers.
They may be  useful in gaining a better understanding of the component
interdependencies, avoiding cloned code as well as detecting plagiarism
in programming classes.</p>
<p>A meaningful measure of  similarity of computer programs often forms
the basis of such tools. While there are a few noteworthy instruments
for similarity assessment, none of them turns out particularly suitable
for analysing R code chunks. Existing solutions rely on rather simple
techniques and heuristics and fail to provide a user with
the kind of sensitivity and specificity required for working with R scripts.
In order to fill this gap, we propose a new algorithm
based on a Program Dependence Graph, implemented in the SimilaR
package. It can serve as a tool not only for improving R code quality
but also for detecting plagiarism, even when it has been masked
by applying some obfuscation techniques or imputing dead code.
We demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency in a real-world case study.</p>

<p>In a paper recently published in the <em>Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS)</em>
(doi:<a class="reference external" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2001064117">10.1073/pnas.2001064117</a>;
joint work with Grzesiek Siudem, Basia Żogała-Siudem and Ania Cena),
we consider the mechanisms behind one’s research success as measured by
one’s papers’ citability. By acknowledging the perceived esteem
might be a consequence not only of how valuable one’s works are
but also of pure luck, we arrived at a model that can accurately
recreate a citation record based on just three parameters: the number
of publications, the total number of citations, and the degree of
randomness in the citation patterns. As a by-product, we show that
a single index will never be able to embrace the complex reality of
the scientific impact. However, three of them can already provide us
with a reliable summary.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
The growing popularity of bibliometric indexes
(whose most famous example is the h index by J. E. Hirsch
[J. E. Hirsch, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 102, 16569–16572 (2005)])
is opposed by those claiming that one’s scientific impact cannot be reduced
to a single number. Some even believe that our complex reality fails
to submit to any quantitative description. We argue that neither of
the two controversial extremes is true. By assuming that some citations
are distributed according to the rich get richer rule (success breeds
success, preferential attachment) while some others are assigned totally
at random (all in all, a paper needs a bibliography), we have crafted
a model that accurately summarizes citation records with merely
three easily interpretable parameters: productivity, total impact,
and how lucky an author has been so far.</p>

<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
We investigate the application of the Ordered Weighted
Averaging (OWA) data fusion operator in agglomerative hierarchical
clustering. The examined setting generalises the well-known single,
complete and average linkage schemes. It allows to embody expert
knowledge in the cluster merge process and to provide a much wider
range of possible linkages. We analyse various families of weighting
functions on numerous benchmark data sets in order to assess their
influence on the resulting cluster structure. Moreover, we inspect
the correction for the inequality of cluster size distribution –
similar to the one in the Genie algorithm. Our results demonstrate
that by robustifying the procedure with the Genie correction,
we can obtain a significant performance boost in terms of clustering
quality. This is particularly beneficial in the case of the linkages
based on the closest distances between clusters, including the single
linkage and its “smoothed” counterparts. To explain this behaviour,
we propose a new linkage process called three-stage OWA which yields
further improvements. This way we confirm the intuition that
hierarchical cluster analysis should rather take into account
a few nearest neighbours of each point, instead of trying to adapt
to their non-local neighbourhood.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
The Sugeno integral is an expressive aggregation function with potential
applications across a range of decision contexts. Its calculation requires
only the lattice minimum and maximum operations, making it particularly suited
to ordinal data and robust to scale transformations.  However, for practical
use in data analysis and prediction, we require efficient methods for learning
the associated fuzzy measure.  While such methods are well developed for the
Choquet integral, the fitting problem is more difficult for the Sugeno integral
because it is not amenable to being expressed as a linear combination of weights,
and more generally due to plateaus and non-differentiability in the objective
function.  Previous research has hence focused on heuristic approaches
or simplified fuzzy measures.   Here we show that the problem of fitting
the Sugeno integral to data such that the maximum absolute error is minimized
can be solved using an efficient bilevel program.    This method can be
incorporated into algorithms that learn fuzzy measures with the aim of
minimizing the median residual.  This equips us with tools that make the
Sugeno integral a feasible option in robust data regression and analysis.
We provide experimental comparison with a genetic algorithms approach and
an example in data analysis.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
The constrained ordered weighted averaging (OWA) aggregation problem
arises when we aim to maximize or minimize a convex combination of order
statistics under linear inequality constraints that act on the variables with
respect to their original sources. The standalone approach to optimizing
the OWA under constraints is to consider all permutations of the inputs,
which becomes quickly infeasible when there are more than a few variables,
however in certain cases we can take advantage of the relationships amongst
the constraints and the corresponding solution structures. For example, we
can consider a land-use allocation satisfaction problem with an auxiliary aim
of balancing land-types, whereby the response curves for each species are
non-decreasing with respect to the land-types. This results in comonotone
constraints, which allow us to drastically reduce the complexity of the problem.</p>
<p>In this paper, we show that if we have an arbitrary number of constraints
that are comonotone (i.e., they share the same ordering permutation of the
coefficients), then the optimal solution occurs for decreasing components of
the solution. After investigating the form of the solution in some special cases
and providing theoretical results that shed light on the form of the solution,
we detail practical approaches to solving and give real-world examples.</p>

The Sugeno integral is a function particularly suited to the aggregation of ordinal inputs.
Defined with respect to a fuzzy measure, its ability to account for complementary and

where it is common for measurements and patient information to be expressed qualitatively.
However, practical applications require well-developed methods for identifying the Sugeno integral’s
parameters, and this task is not easily expressed using the standard optimisation approaches.
Here we formulate the objective function as the difference of two convex functions, which enables
the use of specialised numerical methods.  Such techniques are compared with other global

<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
The property of monotonicity, which requires a function to preserve a given order,
has been considered the standard in the aggregation of real numbers for decades.
In this paper, we argue that, for the case of multidimensional data,
an order-based definition of monotonicity is far too restrictive.
We propose several meaningful alternatives to this property not involving
the preservation of a given order by returning to its early origins stemming
from the field of calculus. Numerous aggregation methods for multidimensional

<em>An inherent difficulty in the aggregation of multidimensional data</em>
by Raúl Pérez-Fernández, Bernard De Baets, and me. Abstract below.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
In the field of information fusion, the problem of data aggregation
has been formalized as an order-preserving process that builds upon
the property of monotonicity. However, fields such as computational
statistics, data analysis and geometry, usually emphasize the role of
equivariances to various geometrical transformations in aggregation processes.
Admittedly, if we consider a unidimensional data fusion task, both requirements
are often compatible with each other. Nevertheless, in this paper we show that,
in the multidimensional setting, the only idempotent functions that are monotone
and orthogonal equivariant are the over-simplistic weighted centroids. Even more,
this result still holds after replacing monotonicity and orthogonal equivariance
by the weaker property of orthomonotonicity. This implies that the
aforementioned approaches to the aggregation of multidimensional data are
irreconcilable, and that, if a weighted centroid is to be avoided, we must
choose between monotonicity and a desirable behaviour with regard to orthogonal
transformations.</p>

<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
On the grounds of the revealed, mutual resemblance between the behaviour

process in the scientific community, we tackled an outwardly
intractable problem of assessing the impact of introducing  “negative” citations.</p>
<p>Although the most frequent reason to cite a paper is to highlight the
connection between the two publications, researchers sometimes mention
an earlier work to cast a negative light. While computing  citation-based scores,
for instance the h-index, information about the reason why a paper was mentioned
is neglected. Therefore it can be questioned whether these indices describe
scientific achievements accurately.</p>
<p>In this contribution we shed insight into the problem of “negative” citations,
analysing data from Stack Exchange and, to draw more universal conclusions,
we derive an approximation of citations scores. Here we show that the quantified
influence of introducing negative citations is  of lesser importance and
that they could be used as an indicator of
where attention of scientific community is allocated.</p>

<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
The problem of the piecewise linear approximation of fuzzy
numbers giving outputs nearest to the inputs with respect to the
Euclidean metric is discussed. The results given in Coroianu et al.
(Fuzzy Sets Syst 233:26–51, 2013) for the 1-knot fuzzy numbers
are generalized for arbitrary n-knot (n&gt;=2) piecewise linear fuzzy numbers.
Some results on the existence and properties of the approximation
operator are proved. Then, the stability of some fuzzy number
characteristics under approximation as the number of knots tends
to infinity is considered. Finally, a simulation study concerning
the computer implementations of arithmetic operations on fuzzy numbers
is provided. Suggested concepts are illustrated by examples and
algorithms ready for the practical use. This way, we throw a bridge
between theory and applications as the latter ones are so desired in
real-world problems.</p>

<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
The problem of learning symmetric capacities (or fuzzy measures)
from data is investigated toward applications in data analysis

regarding the solution minimizing the mean absolute  error
are exploited to develop an exact branch-refine-and-bound-type algorithm
for fitting Sugeno integrals (weighted lattice polynomial functions,
max-min operators) with respect to symmetric capacities.
The proposed method turns out to be particularly suitable for acting
on ordinal data. In addition to providing a model that can be used
for the general data regression task, the results can  be used,
among others, to calibrate generalized h-indices to bibliometric data.</p>

<p><em>The efficacy of league formats in ranking teams</em> has been accepted for publication

<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
The efficacy of different league formats in ranking teams according to
their true latent strength is analysed. To this end, a new approach for
estimating attacking and defensive strengths based on the Poisson
regression for modelling match outcomes is proposed. Various performance
metrics are estimated reflecting the agreement between latent teams’
strength parameters and their final rank in the league table. The
tournament designs studied here are used in the majority of European
top-tier association football competitions. Based on numerical experiments,
it turns out that a two-stage league format comprising of the three
round-robin tournament together with an extra single round-robin is the
most efficacious setting. In particular, it is the most accurate in
selecting the best team as the winner of the league. Its efficacy can be
enhanced by setting the number of points allocated for a win to two
(instead of three that is currently in effect in association football).</p>

<p>Today,
at the <em>International Student Conference on Applied Mathematics
and Informatics – ISCAMI 2018</em>
held in Malenovice, Czechia,
I gave a lecture entitled <em>Clustering on MSTs</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
Cluster analysis is one of the most commonly applied unsupervised machine
learning techniques. Its aim is to automatically discover an underlying
structure of a data set represented by a partition of its elements:
mutually disjoint and nonempty subsets are determined in such a way
that observations within each group are “similar” and entities in distinct
clusters “differ” as much as possible from each other.</p>
<p>It turns out that two state-of-the-art clustering algorithms – namely
the Genie and HDBSCAN* methods – can be computed based on the minimum spanning
tree (MST) of the pairwise dissimilarity graph. Both of them are not only
resistant to outliers and produce high-quality partitions, but also are
relatively fast to compute.</p>
<p>The aim of this tutorial is to discuss some key issues of hierarchical
clustering and explore their relations with graph and data aggregation theory.</p>

The aggregation of several objects into a single one is a common
study subject in mathematics. Unfortunately, whereas practitioners
often need to deal with the aggregation of many different types of
objects (rankings, graphs, strings, etc.), the current theory of
aggregation is mostly developed for dealing with the aggregation of
values in a poset. In this presentation, we will reflect on the
limitations of this poset-based theory of aggregation and “jump through
the poset glass”. On the other side, we will not find Wonderland,
but, instead, we will find more questions than answers. Indeed,
a new theory of aggregation is being born, and we will need to work
together on this reboot for years to come.</p>

We look at different approaches to learning the weights of the
weighted arithmetic mean such that the median residual or sum of the
smallest half of squared residuals is minimized. The more general problem
of multivariate regression has been well studied in statistical literature
however in the case of aggregation functions we have the restriction on
the weights and the domain is usually restricted so that ‘outliers’ may
not be arbitrarily large. A number of algorithms are compared in terms
of accuracy and speed. Our results can be extended to other aggregation
functions.</p>

<p>Today I gave a lecture at the <em>14th International Conference of Fuzzy Set
Theory and Applications – FSTA 2018</em>
held in Liptovský Ján, Slovak Republic.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
Hirsch’s h-index is perhaps the most popular citation-based measure
of scientific excellence. Many of its natural generalizations
can be expressed as simple functions of some discrete Sugeno integrals.</p>
<p>In this talk we shall review some less-known results concerning various stochastic properties
of the discrete Sugeno integral with respect to a symmetric normalized capacity,
i.e., weighted lattice polynomial functions of real-valued random variables
– both in i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) and non-i.i.d.
(with some dependence structure) cases. For instance, we will be interested
in investigating
their exact and asymptotic distributions.
Based on these, we can, among others, show that the h-index is a consistent
estimator of some natural probability distribution’s location characteristic.
Moreover, we can derive a statistical test to verify whether
the difference between two h-indices (say, h’=7 vs. h’’=10 in cases where both authors
published 40 papers) is actually significant.</p>
<p>What is more, we shall discuss some agent-based models that describe the processes
generating citation networks based on, e.g.,  the preferential attachment
(“rich gets richer”) rule.
Due to such an approach, we are able to simulate a scientist’s activity
and then estimate the expected values for the h-index and similar functions
based on very simple sample statistics, such as the total number of citations
and the total number of publications.
Such results can help explain what does the h-index really measure.</p>

Choosing between different tournament designs based on their
accuracy in ranking teams is an important topic in football since many
domestic championships underwent changes in the recent years. In particular,
the transformations of Ekstraklasa – the top-tier football competition in
Poland – is a topic receiving much attention from the organizing body of the
competition, participating football clubs as well as supporters. In this
presentation we will discuss the problem of measuring the accuracy of
different league formats in ranking teams. We will present various models for
rating teams that will be next used to simulate a number of tournaments to
evaluate their efficacy, for example, by measuring the probability of the best
team win. Finally, we will discuss several other aspects of league formats
including the influence of the number of points allocated for a win on the
final league standings.</p>

### MADAM Seminar: How accidental scientific success is? (Grzegorz Siudem)

> 2017-11-24



On November 24, 2017 at the [MADAM](http://madam.mini.pw.edu.pl) (Methods for Analysis
of Data: Algorithms and Modeling) seminar,
Dr [Grzegorz Siudem](http://www.if.pw.edu.pl/~siudem/)
(Faculty of Physics, Warsaw University of Technology)
will discuss a new agent-based model for citation networks.



> **Abstract.**
Since the classic work of de Sola Price the rich-gets-richer rule is well
known as the most important mechanism governing the citation network dynamics.
(Un-)Fortunatelly it is not sufficient to explain every aspect of
bibliometric data. Using the proposed agent-based model for the bibliometric
networks we will shed some light on the problem and try to answer
the important question
stated in the title. Joint work with A. Cena, M. Gagolewski and B. Żogała-Siudem.

### Measuring Traffic Congestion

> 2017-07-06 #new paper



*Measuring traffic congestion: An approach based on learning
weighted inequality, spread and aggregation indices from comparison data*
has been accepted for publication in *Applied Soft Computing*.
Assigned DOI is [10.1016/j.asoc.2017.07.014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2017.07.014).


Simon James did a wonderful work leading this research project.
The paper was written in collaboration with researchers from Deakin University,
namely:
Gleb Beliakov, Shannon Pace, Nicola Pastorello, Elodie Thilliez, and Rajesh Vasa.

> **Abstract.**
As cities increase in size, governments and councils face the problem of
designing infrastructure and approaches to traffic management that alleviate
congestion. The problem of objectively measuring congestion involves taking
into account not only the volume of traffic moving throughout a network, but
also the inequality or spread of this traffic over major and minor intersections.
For modelling such data, we investigate the use of weighted congestion indices
based on various aggregation and spread functions. We formulate the weight
learning problem for comparison data and use real traffic data obtained from
a medium-sized Australian city to evaluate their usefulness.



### Invited Tutorial @ AGOP 2017

> 2017-06-21 #invited talk



Today I gave a tutorial at the *<a href="http://www.mdai.cat/agop2017/">9th
International Summer School on Aggregation Operators &ndash; AGOP 2017</a>*
held at University of Skövde, Sweden.


> **Abstract.**
Aggregation theory classically deals with functions to summarize
a sequence of numeric values, e.g., in the unit interval.
Since the notion of componentwise monotonicity plays a key role in many
situations, there is an increasingly growing interest in methods
that act on diverse ordered structures.
</p><p>
However, as far as the definition of a mean or an averaging function
is concerned, the internality (or at least idempotence) property
seems to be of a relatively higher importance than the monotonicity condition.
In particular, the Bajraktarević means or the mode are among some
well-known non-monotone means.
</p><p>
The concept of a penalty-based function
was first investigated by Yager in 1993.
In such a framework, we are interested in minimizing the amount of "disagreement"
between the inputs  and the output being computed;
the corresponding aggregation functions are at least idempotent
and express many existing means in an intuitive and attractive way.
</p><p>
In this talk I focus on the notion of penalty-based
aggregation of sequences of points in R<sup>d</sup>, this time for some d≥1.
I review three noteworthy subclasses of penalty functions:
componentwise extensions of unidimensional ones, those constructed upon
pairwise distances between observations, and those defined by
measuring the so-called data depth.
Then, I discuss their formal properties, which are particularly
useful from the perspective of data analysis, e.g., different possible
generalizations of  internality  or equivariances to various geometric transforms.
I also point out the difficulties with extending some notions that are key
in classical aggregation theory, like the monotonicity property.

### Penalty-Based Aggregation of Multidimensional Data

> 2016-12-12 #new paper



My paper *Penalty-Based Aggregation of Multidimensional Data*
has been accepted for publication in *Fuzzy Sets and Systems*
(Special Issue on Aggregation Functions).


> **Abstract.**
Research in aggregation theory is nowadays still mostly focused on algorithms
to summarize tuples consisting of observations in some real interval
or of diverse general ordered structures. Of course, in practice
of information processing many other data types between these
two extreme cases are worth inspecting. This contribution deals with
the aggregation of lists of data points in <strong>R</strong><sup>d</sup> for arbitrary d≥1.
Even though particular functions aiming to summarize multidimensional data
have been discussed by researchers in data analysis,
computational statistics and geometry, there is clearly a need to provide
a comprehensive and unified model in which their properties
like equivariances to geometric transformations, internality, and monotonicity
may be studied at an appropriate level of generality.
The proposed penalty-based approach
serves as a common framework for all idempotent information aggregation
methods, including componentwise functions,
pairwise distance minimizers, and data depth-based medians. It also
allows for deriving many new practically useful tools.

### Penalty-Based and Other Representations of Economic Inequality

> 2016-10-27 #new paper



My paper with Gleb Beliakov and Simon James,
entitled *Penalty-based and other representations of economic inequality*,
has been accepted for publication in * International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems* today.


> **Abstract.**
Economic inequality measures are employed as a key component in various
socio-demographic indices to capture the disparity between the wealthy and poor.
Since their inception, they have also been used as a basis for modelling spread
and disparity in other contexts. While recent research has identified that
a number of classical inequality and welfare functions can be considered
in the framework of OWA operators, here we propose a framework of penalty-based
aggregation functions and their associated penalties as measures of inequality.



### Invited Talk @ European R Users Meeting 2016

> 2016-10-14 #invited talk



Today I gave an invited talk
(*Genie: A new, fast, and outlier-resistant hierarchical clustering algorithm and its R interface*)
at the [European R Users Meeting](http://erum.ue.poznan.pl/) that is held in Poznań, Poland.


> **Abstract.**
The time needed to apply a hierarchical clustering algorithm is most
often dominated by the number of computations of a pairwise
dissimilarity measure. Such a constraint, for larger data sets, puts at
a disadvantage the use of all the classical linkage criteria but the
single linkage one. However, it is known that the single linkage
clustering algorithm is very sensitive to outliers, produces highly
skewed dendrograms, and therefore usually does not reflect the true
underlying data structure - unless the clusters are well-separated.
<br />
To overcome its limitations, we proposed a new hierarchical clustering
linkage criterion called genie. Namely, our algorithm links two
clusters in such a way that a chosen economic inequity measure (e.g.,
the Gini or Bonferroni index) of the cluster sizes does not increase
drastically above a given threshold.
<br />
Benchmarks indicate a high practical usefulness of the introduced
method: it most often outperforms the Ward or average linkage in terms
of the clustering quality while retaining the single linkage speed. The
algorithm is easily parallelizable and thus may be run on multiple
threads to speed up its execution further on. Its memory overhead is
small: there is no need to precompute the complete distance matrix to
perform the computations in order to obtain a desired clustering. In
this talk we will discuss its reference implementation, included in the
genie package for R.



### Invited Plenary Talk @ ISAS 2016

> 2016-07-06 #invited talk



Today I gave a plenary talk at the [International Symposium on Aggregation and Structures &ndash; ISAS 2016](http://math.uni.lu/isas/), entitled
*Penalty-based fusion of complex data, computational aspects, and applications*.


> **Abstract.**
Since the 1980s, studies of aggregation functions most often
focus on the construction and formal analysis of diverse ways
to summarize numerical lists with elements in some real interval.
Quite recently, we also observe an increasing interest in aggregation
*of* and aggregation *on* generic partially ordered sets.
<br />
However, in many practical applications, we have no natural ordering
of given data items. Thus, in this talk we review
various aggregation methods in spaces equipped merely with
a semimetric (distance).
These include the concept of such penalty minimizers as the centroid,
1-median, 1-center, medoid, and their generalizations
-- all leading to idempotent fusion functions.
Special emphasis is placed on procedures to summarize vectors
in R<sup>d</sup> for d &ge; 2 (e.g., rows in numeric data frames)
as well as character strings (e.g., DNA sequences),
but of course the list of other interesting domains
could go on forever (rankings, graphs, images, time series, and so on).
<br />
We discuss some of their formal properties, exact
or approximate (if the underlying optimization task is hard)
algorithms to compute them and their applications
in clustering and classification tasks.



### Hierarchical Clustering via Penalty-Based Aggregation and the Genie Approach

> 2016-06-07 #new paper



The following paper has been accepted for publication in Proceedings of [MDAI 2016](http://www.mdai.cat/mdai2016/venue.php):
<span style="font-variant:small-caps"><strong>Gagolewski M.</strong>, Cena A., Bartoszuk M.</span>,
Hierarchical Clustering via Penalty-Based Aggregation and the Genie Approach,
*Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence*, Springer, 2016.




> **Abstract.**  The paper discusses a generalization of the nearest centroid hierarchical
clustering algorithm. A first extension deals with the incorporation
of generic distance-based penalty minimizers instead of the classical
aggregation by means of centroids. Due to that the presented algorithm can be applied
in spaces equipped with an arbitrary dissimilarity measure (images, DNA sequences, etc.).
Secondly, a correction preventing the formation
of clusters of too highly unbalanced sizes is applied: just like in the
recently introduced *Genie* approach, which extends the single linkage scheme,
the new method averts a chosen inequity measure (e.g., the Gini-, de Vergottini-,
or Bonferroni-index) of cluster sizes from raising above a predefined
threshold. Numerous benchmarks indicate that the introduction of such
a correction increases the quality of the resulting clusterings.



### *stringi* 1.1.1 released

### Proc. IPMU'2016: 3 Papers Accepted

> 2016-03-09 #new paper



Three papers which I co-author:
*Fitting aggregation functions to data: Part I  &ndash; Linearization and regularization*,
*Fitting aggregation functions to data: Part II &ndash; Idempotentization* (co-authors: Maciej Bartoszuk, Gleb Beliakov, Simon James), and
*Fuzzy k-minpen clustering and k-nearest-minpen classification procedures incorporating generic distance-based penalty minimizers*
(co-author: Anna Cena)
have been accepted for the [IPMU 2016](http://is.ieis.tue.nl/ipmu/) conference.



1st paper:

> **Abstract.**
The use of supervised learning techniques for fitting weights and/or generator
functions of weighted quasi-arithmetic means &ndash; a special class of idempotent
and nondecreasing aggregation functions &ndash; to empirical data has already been
considered in a number of papers.
Nevertheless, there are still some important issues that  have not been
discussed in the literature yet. In the first part of this two-part contribution
we deal with the concept of regularization, a quite standard technique from machine learning
applied so as to increase the fit quality on test and validation data samples.
Due to the  constraints on the weighting vector,
it turns out that quite different methods can be used in the current framework, as
compared to regression models.
Moreover, it is worth noting that so far fitting weighted
quasi-arithmetic means to empirical data has only been performed
approximately, via the so-called linearization technique.
In this paper we consider exact solutions to such special optimization tasks
and indicate cases where linearization leads to much worse solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Keywords.</strong> Aggregation functions, weighted quasi-arithmetic means,
least squares fitting, regularization, linearization

2nd paper:

> **Abstract.**
The use of supervised learning techniques for fitting weights and/or generator
functions of weighted quasi-arithmetic means &ndash; a special class of idempotent
and nondecreasing aggregation functions &ndash; to empirical data has already been
considered in a number of papers.
Nevertheless, there are still some important issues that  have not been
discussed in the literature yet. In the second part of this two-part contribution
we deal with a quite common situation in which we have inputs coming from
different sources, describing a similar phenomenon, but which
have not been properly normalized. In such a case,
idempotent and nondecreasing functions cannot be used to aggregate them
unless proper pre-processing is performed.
The proposed idempotization method, based on the notion of B-splines,
allows for an automatic calibration of  independent variables.
The introduced technique is applied in an R source code plagiarism
detection system.</p><p><strong>Keywords.</strong> Aggregation functions, weighted quasi-arithmetic means,
least squares fitting, idempotence

3rd paper:

> **Abstract.**
We discuss a generalization of the fuzzy (weighted) k-means clustering procedure
and point out its relationships with data aggregation in spaces equipped with
arbitrary dissimilarity measures. In the proposed setting, a
data set partitioning is performed based on the notion of points' proximity to generic
distance-based penalty minimizers. Moreover, a new data classification algorithm,
resembling the k-nearest neighbors scheme but less computationally and memory
demanding, is introduced. Rich examples in complex data domains
indicate the usability of the methods and aggregation theory in general.</p>

A short paper entitled *H-index and other Sugeno integrals: Some deffects and their compensation*,
by Radko Mesiar and Marek Gagolewski, has been accepted
for publication in *IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems*.



<blockquote><div>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
*The famous Hirsch index has been introduced just ca. 10 years ago.
Despite that, it is already widely used in many decision making
tasks, like in evaluation of individual scientists, research
grant allocation, or even production planning.
It is known that the h-index is related to the discrete
Sugeno integral and the Ky Fan metric introduced in 1940s.
The aim of this paper is to propose a few modifications of this index
as well as other fuzzy integrals -- also on bounded chains -- that lead
to better discrimination of some types of data that are to be aggregated.
All of the suggested compensation methods try to retain the simplicity
of the original measure.

*Agent-based model for the h-index &ndash; Exact solution*
by Żogała-Siudem B., Siudem G., Cena A., and Gagolewski M. has been accepted
for publication in *European Physical Journal B* (assigned doi:10.1140/epjb/e2015-60757-1).



<blockquote><div>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
*The Hirsch's h-index is perhaps the most popular citation-based measure
of the scientific excellence. In 2013 G. Ionescu and B. Chopard proposed
an agent-based model for this index to describe a publications and citations
generation process in an abstract scientific community. With such an approach
one can simulate a single scientist's activity, and by extension investigate
the whole community of researchers. Even though this approach predicts quite
well the h-index from bibliometric data, only a solution based on
simulations was given. In this paper, we complete their results with exact,
analytic formulas. What is more, due to our exact solution we are able to
simplify the Ionescu-Chopard model which allows us to obtain a compact
formula for h-index. Moreover, a simulation study designed to compare both,
approximated and exact, solutions is included. The last part of this paper
presents evaluation of the obtained results on a real-word data set.

### stringi 1.0-1 Now on CRAN

> 2015-10-22 #software





Notable changes since v0.5-2:


* [GENERAL] #88: C++ API is now available for use in, e.g., Rcpp packages, see
https://github.com/Rexamine/ExampleRcppStringi for an example.

* [BUGFIX] #183: Floating point exception raised in `stri_sub()` and
`stri_sub&lt;-()` when `to` or `length` was a zero-length numeric vector.

* [BUGFIX] #180: `stri_c()` warned incorrectly (recycling rule) when using more
than 2 elements.



### Accepted Paper in *Journal of Applied Statistics*

> 2015-09-23 #new paper



"How to improve a team's position in the FIFA ranking &ndash; A simulation study"
by Lasek J., Szlavik Z., Gagolewski M., and Bhulai S. has been accepted
for publication in *Journal of Applied Statistics*.



<blockquote><div>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
*In this paper, we study the efficacy of the official ranking for international football teams compiled by FIFA,
the body governing football competition around the globe. We present strategies for improving a team's position in the ranking.
By combining several statistical techniques we derive an objective function in a decision problem of optimal
scheduling of future matches. The presented results display how a team's position can be improved.
Along the way, we compare the official procedure to the famous Elo rating system. Although it originates
from chess, it has been successfully tailored to ranking football teams as well.

Here is the <a href='http://www.nauka.gov.pl/komunikaty/minister-nauki-i-szkolnictwa-wyzszego-przyznala-48-801-060-zl-na-finansowanie-stypendiow-naukowych-dla-wybitnych-mlodych-naukowcow.html'>complete list
of laureates</a> (in Polish).


### stringi 0.5-2 Now on CRAN

> 2015-06-22 #software



A new release of the [top downloaded R extensions](https://github.com/Rexamine/stringi/">*stringi*</a> package is available on <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringi/index.html">CRAN</a>. As for now, about 850 CRAN packages depend (either directly or recursively) on *stringi*. And quite recently, the package got listed among the <a href="http://www.r-pkg.org/downloaded).



Notable changes since v0.4-1:


* [BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY] The second argument to `stri_pad_*()` has
been renamed `width`.

* [GENERAL] #69: *stringi* is now bundled with ICU4C 55.1.

* [NEW FUNCTIONS] `stri_extract_*_boundaries()` extract text between text
boundaries.

* [NEW FUNCTION] #46: `stri_trans_char()` is a *stringi*-flavoured
`chartr()` equivalent.

* [NEW FUNCTION] #8: `stri_width()` approximates the *width* of a string
in a more Unicodish fashion than `nchar(..., "width")`

* [NEW FEATURE] #149: `stri_pad()` and `stri_wrap()` now by default bases on
code point widths instead of the number of code points. Moreover, the default
behavior of `stri_wrap()` is now such that it does not get rid
of non-breaking, zero width, etc. spaces

* [NEW FEATURE] #133: `stri_wrap()` silently allows for `width <= 0`
(for compatibility with `strwrap()`).

* [NEW FEATURE] #139: `stri_wrap()` gained a new argument: `whitespace_only`.

* [NEW FUNCTIONS] #137: date-time formatting/parsing:
* `stri_timezone_list()` - lists all known time zone identifiers
* `stri_timezone_set()`, `stri_timezone_get()` - manage current default time zone
* `stri_timezone_info()` - basic information on a given time zone
* `stri_datetime_symbols()` - localizable date-time formatting data
* `stri_datetime_fstr()` - convert a `strptime`-like format string
to an ICU date/time format string
* `stri_datetime_format()` - convert date/time to string
* `stri_datetime_parse()` - convert string to date/time object
* `stri_datetime_create()` - construct date-time objects
from numeric representations
* `stri_datetime_now()` - return current date-time
* `stri_datetime_fields()` - get values for date-time fields
* `stri_datetime_add()` - add specific number of date-time units
to a date-time object

* [GENERAL] #144: Performance improvements in handling ASCII strings
(these affect `stri_sub()`, `stri_locate()` and other string index-based
operations)

* [GENERAL] #143: Searching for short fixed patterns (`stri_*_fixed()`) now
relies on the current `libC`'s implementation of `strchr()` and `strstr()`.
This is very fast e.g. on `glibc` utilizing the `SSE2/3/4` instruction set.

* [BUILD TIME] #141: a local copy of `icudt*.zip` may be used on package
install; see the `INSTALL` file for more information.

* [BUILD TIME] #165: the `./configure` option `--disable-icu-bundle`
forces the use of system ICU when building the package.

* [BUGFIX] locale specifiers are now normalized in a more intelligent way:
e.g. `@calendar=gregorian` expands to `DEFAULT_LOCALE@calendar=gregorian`.

* [BUGFIX] #134: `stri_extract_all_words()` did not accept `simplify=NA`.

* [BUGFIX] #132: incorrect behavior in `stri_locate_regex()` for matches
of zero lengths

* [BUGFIX] stringr/#73: `stri_wrap()` returned `CHARSXP` instead of `STRSXP`
on empty string input with `simplify=FALSE` argument.

* [BUGFIX] #164: `libicu-dev` usage used to fail on Ubuntu
(`LIBS` shall be passed after `LDFLAGS` and the list of `.o` files).

* [BUGFIX] #168: Build now fails if `icudt` is not available.

* [BUGFIX] #135: C++11 is now used by default (see the `INSTALL` file,
however) to build *stringi* from sources. This is because ICU4C uses the
`long long` type which is not part of the C++98 standard.

* [BUGFIX] #154: Dates and other objects with a custom class attribute
were not coerced to the character type correctly.

* [BUGFIX] Force ICU `u_init()` call on *stringi* dynlib load.

* [BUGFIX] #157: many overfull hboxes in the package PDF manual has been
corrected.

### Accepted Paper in *Journal of Informetrics*

> 2015-02-06 #new paper



<p>Cena A., Gagolewski M., Mesiar R., Problems and challenges of
information resources producers' clustering, *Journal of Informetrics*,
2015, doi:10.1016/j.joi.2015.02.005; has been accepted for publication.</p>


<blockquote><div>
<strong>Abstract:</strong>
*Classically, unsupervised machine learning techniques are applied on data sets
with fixed number of attributes (variables). However, many problems
encountered in the field of informetrics face us with the need to extend
these kinds of methods in a way such that they may be computed over a set of
nonincreasingly ordered vectors of unequal lengths. Thus, in this paper,
some new dissimilarity measures (metrics) are introduced and studied.
Owing to that we may use i.a. hierarchical clustering algorithms in order to
determine an input data set's partition consisting of sets of producers that
are homogeneous not only with respect to the quality of information
resources, but also their quantity.

## 2014

### stringi_0.4-1 Released

> 2014-12-14 #software



Yet another official release of the *stringi*
package for R is on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringi/) now.
This time we particularly focused  on a better compatibility of stringi
with [stringr](https://github.com/hadley/stringr).



Notable changes since v0.3-1:


* [IMPORTANT CHANGE] `n_max` argument in `stri_split_*()` has been renamed `n`.

* [IMPORTANT CHANGE] `simplify=FALSE` in `stri_extract_all_*()` and
`stri_split_*()` now calls `stri_list2matrix()` with `fill=""`.
`fill=NA_character_` may be obtained by using `simplify=NA`.

* [IMPORTANT CHANGE, NEW FUNCTIONS] #120: `stri_extract_words` has been
renamed `stri_extract_all_words` and `stri_locate_boundaries` -
`stri_locate_all_boundaries` as well as `stri_locate_words` -
`stri_locate_all_words`. New functions are now available:
`stri_locate_first_boundaries`, `stri_locate_last_boundaries`,
`stri_locate_first_words`, `stri_locate_last_words`,
`stri_extract_first_words`, `stri_extract_last_words`.

* [IMPORTANT CHANGE] #111: `opts_regex`, `opts_collator`, `opts_fixed`, and
`opts_brkiter` can now be supplied individually via `...`.
In other words, you may now simply call e.g.
`stri_detect_regex(str, pattern, case_insensitive=TRUE)` instead of
`stri_detect_regex(str, pattern, opts_regex=stri_opts_regex(case_insensitive=TRUE))`.

* [NEW FEATURE] #110: Fixed pattern search engine's settings can
now be supplied via `opts_fixed` argument in `stri_*_fixed()`,
see `stri_opts_fixed()`. A simple (not suitable for natural language
processing) yet very fast `case_insensitive` pattern matching can be
performed now. `stri_extract_*_fixed` is again available.

* [NEW FEATURE] #23: `stri_extract_all_fixed`, `stri_count`, and
`stri_locate_all_fixed` may now also look for overlapping pattern
matches, see `?stri_opts_fixed`.

* [NEW FEATURE] #129: `stri_match_*_regex` gained a `cg_missing` argument.

* [NEW FEATURE] #117: `stri_extract_all_*()`, `stri_locate_all_*()`,
`stri_match_all_*()` gained a new argument: `omit_no_match`.
Setting it to `TRUE` makes these functions compatible with their
`stringr` equivalents.

* [NEW FEATURE] #118: `stri_wrap()` gained `indent`, `exdent`, `initial`,
and `prefix` arguments. Moreover Knuth's dynamic word wrapping algorithm
now assumes that the cost of printing the last line is zero, see #128.

* [NEW FEATURE] #122: `stri_subset()` gained an `omit_na` argument.

* [NEW FEATURE] `stri_list2matrix()` gained an `n_min` argument.

* [NEW FEATURE] #126: `stri_split()` now is also able to act
just like `stringr::str_split_fixed()`.

* [NEW FEATURE] #119:  `stri_split_boundaries()` now have
`n`, `tokens_only`, and `simplify` arguments. Additionally,
`stri_extract_all_words()` is now equipped with `simplify` arg.

* [NEW FEATURE] #116: `stri_paste()` gained a new argument:
`ignore_null`. Setting it to `TRUE` makes this function more compatible
with `paste()`.

* [NEW FEATURE] #114: `stri_paste()`: `ignore_null` arg has been added.

* [OTHER] #123: `useDynLib` is used to speed up symbol look-up in
the compiled dynamic library.

* [BUGFIX]  #94: Run-time errors on Solaris caused by setting
`-DU_DISABLE_RENAMING=1` -- memory allocation errors in i.a. ICU's
UnicodeString. This setting also caused some ABSan sanity check
failures within ICU code.

### stringi_0.3-1 Released

> 2014-11-06 #software



The third official release of the *stringi*
package for R is on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringi/) now.



Notable changes since v0.2-5:


* [IMPORTANT CHANGE] #87: `%>%` overlapped with the pipe operator from
the `magrittr` package; now each operator like `%>%` has been renamed `%s>%`.

* [IMPORTANT CHANGE] #108: Now the BreakIterator (for text boundary analysis)
may be better controlled via `stri_opts_brkiter()` (see options `type`
and `locale` which aim to replace now-removed `boundary` and `locale` parameters
to `stri_locate_boundaries`, `stri_split_boundaries`, `stri_trans_totitle`,
`stri_extract_words`, `stri_locate_words`).

* [NEW FUNCTIONS] #109: `stri_count_boundaries` and `stri_count_words`
count the number of text boundaries in a string.

* [NEW FUNCTIONS] #41: `stri_startswith_*` and `stri_endswith_*`
determine whether a string starts or ends with a given pattern.

* [NEW FEATURE] #102: `stri_replace_all_*` gained a `vectorize_all` parameter,
which defaults to TRUE for backward compatibility.

* [NEW FUNCTION] #91: `stri_subset_*`, a convenient and more efficient
substitute for `str[stri_detect_*(str, ...)]`, added.

* [NEW FEATURE] #100: `stri_split_fixed`, `stri_split_charclass`,
`stri_split_regex`, `stri_split_coll` gained a `tokens_only` parameter,
which defaults to `FALSE` for backward compatibility.

* [NEW FUNCTION] #105: `stri_list2matrix` converts lists of atomic vectors
to character matrices, useful in connection with `stri_split`
and `stri_extract`.

* [NEW FEATURE] #107: `stri_split_*` now allow setting an `omit_empty=NA` argument.

* [NEW FEATURE] #106: `stri_split` and `stri_extract_all` gained a `simplify`
argument (if `TRUE`, then `stri_list2matrix(..., byrow=TRUE)`
is called on the resulting list.

* [NEW FUNCTION] #77: `stri_rand_lipsum` generates
(pseudo)random dummy *lorem ipsum* text.

* [NEW FEATURE] #98: `stri_trans_totitle` gained a `opts_brkiter`
parameter; it indicates which ICU BreakIterator should be used when
performing case mapping.

* [NEW FEATURE] `stri_wrap` gained a new parameter: `normalize`.

* [BUGFIX] #86: `stri_*_fixed`, `stri_*_coll`, and `stri_*_regex` could
give incorrect results if one of search strings were of length 0.

* [BUGFIX] #99: `stri_replace_all` did not use the `replacement` arg.

* [BUGFIX] #94: `R CMD check` should no longer fail if `icudt` download failed.

* [BUGFIX] #112: Some of the objects were not PROTECTed from
being garbage collected, which might have caused spontaneous SEGFAULTS.

* [BUGFIX] Some collator's options were not passed correctly to ICU services.

* [BUGFIX] Memory leaks causes as detected by
`valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full` have been removed.

* [DOCUMENTATION] Significant extensions/clean ups in the stringi manual.

### Spread Measures and Their Relation to Aggregation Functions &ndash; Accepted Paper

> 2014-08-22 #new paper



The paper Gagolewski M.,
*Spread measures and their relation to aggregation functions*
has just been accepted for publication in *European Journal of Operational Research*.


<blockquote><div>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> *The theory of aggregation most often deals with measures of central tendency.
However, sometimes a very different kind of a numeric vector's synthesis into a
single number is required. In this paper we introduce a class of mathematical functions
which aim to measure spread or scatter of one-dimensional quantitative data.
The proposed definition serves as a common, abstract framework for measures of
absolute spread known from statistics, exploratory data analysis and data mining,
e.g. the sample variance, standard deviation, range, interquartile range (IQR),
median absolute deviation (MAD), etc. Additionally, we develop new measures
of experts' opinions diversity or consensus in group decision making problems.
We investigate some properties of spread measures, show how are they related to
aggregation functions, and indicate their new potentially fruitful application areas.*



### IEEE IS'14 Proceedings Paper Accepted

> 2014-06-17 #new paper



Accepted for publication in Proc. IEEE IS 2014:
Gagolewski M., Lasek J., *The use of fuzzy relations in the assessment of information resources producers' performance*.


### SMPS'14 Proceedings Paper Accepted

> 2014-05-26 #new paper



Accepted for publication in Proc. SMPS 2014:
Gagolewski M., *Sugeno integral-based confidence intervals for the theoretical h-index*.


### stringi_0.2-3 Released

> 2014-05-14 #software



The second official release of the *stringi*
package for R is on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringi/) now.



Notable changes since v0.1-25:


* [IMPORTANT CHANGE] stri_cmp* now do not allow for passing opts_collator=NA.
From now on, stri_cmp_eq, stri_cmp_neq, and the new operators
%===%, %!==%, %stri===%, and %stri!==% are locale-independent operations,
which base on code point comparisons. New functions stri_cmp_equiv
and stri_cmp_nequiv (and from now on also %==%, %!=%, %stri==%,
and %stri!=%) test for canonical equivalence.

* [IMPORTANT CHANGE] stri_*_fixed search functions now perform
a locale-independent exact (bytewise, of course after conversion to UTF-8)
pattern search. All the Collator-based, locale-dependent search routines
are now available via stri_*_coll. The reason for this is that
ICU USearch has currently very poor performance and in many search tasks
in fact it is sufficient to do exact pattern matching.

* [IMPORTANT CHANGE] stri_enc_nf* and stri_enc_isnf* function families
have been renamed to stri_trans_nf* and stri_trans_isnf*, respectively.
This is because they deal with text transforming, and not with character
encoding. Moreover, all such operation may be performed by
ICU's Transliterator (see below).

* [IMPORTANT CHANGE] stri_*_charclass search functions now
rely solely on ICU's UnicodeSet patterns. All previously accepted
charclass identifiers became invalid. However, new patterns
should now be more familiar to the users (they are regex-like).
Moreover, we observe a very nice performance gain.

* [IMPORTANT CHANGE] stri_sort now does not include NAs
in output vectors by default, for compatibility with sort().
Moreover, currently none of the input vector's attributes are preserved.

* [NEW FUNCTION] stri_trans_general, stri_trans_list gives access
to ICU's Transliterator: may be used to perform very general
text transforms.

* [NEW FUNCTION stri_split_boundaries utilizes ICU's BreakIterator
to split strings at specific text boundaries. Moreover,
stri_locate_boundaries indicates positions of these boundaries.

* [NEW FUNCTION] stri_extract_words uses ICU's BreakIterator to
extract all words from a text. Additionally, stri_locate_words
locates start and end positions of words in a text.

* [NEW FUNCTION] stri_pad, stri_pad_left, stri_pad_right, stri_pad_both
pads a string with a specific code point.

* [NEW FUNCTION] stri_wrap breaks paragraphs of text into lines.
Two algorihms (greedy and minimal-raggedness) are available.

* [NEW FUNCTION] stri_unique extracts unique elements from
a character vector.

* [NEW FUNCTIONS] stri_duplicated any stri_duplicated_any
determine duplicate elements in a character vector.

* [NEW FUNCTION] stri_replace_na replaces NAs in a character vector
with a given string, useful for emulating e.g. R's paste() behavior.

* [NEW FUNCTION] stri_rand_shuffle generates a random permutation
of code points in a string.

* [NEW FUNCTION] stri_rand_strings generates random strings.

* [NEW FUNCTIONS] New functions and binary operators for string comparison:
stri_cmp_eq, stri_cmp_neq, stri_cmp_lt, stri_cmp_le, stri_cmp_gt,
stri_cmp_ge, %==%, %!=%, %&lt;%, %&lt;=%, %&gt;%, %&gt;=%.

* [NEW FUNCTION] stri_enc_mark reads declared encodings of character strings
as seen by stringi.

* [NEW FUNCTION] stri_enc_tonative(str) is an alias to
stri_encode(str, NULL, NULL).

* [NEW FEATURE] stri_order and stri_sort now have an additional argument
`na_last` (defaults to TRUE and NA, respectively).

* [NEW FEATURE] stri_replace_all_charclass now has `merge` arg
(defaults to FALSE for backward-compatibility). It may be used
to e.g. replace sequences of white spaces with a single space.

* [NEW FEATURE] stri_enc_toutf8 now has a new `validate` arg (defaults
to FALSE for backward-compatibility). It may be used in a (rare) case
in which a user wants to fix an invalid UTF-8 byte sequence.
stri_length (among others) now detect invalid UTF-8 byte sequences.

* [NEW FEATURE] All binary operators %???% now also have aliases %stri???%.

* stri_*_fixed now use a tweaked Knuth-Morris-Pratt search algorithm,
which improves the search performance drastically.

* Significant performance improvements in stri_join, stri_flatten,
stri_cmp, stri_trans_to*, and others.

### stringi_0.1-25 Now on CRAN

> 2014-03-12 #software



The initial release of the *stringi*
package for R is now available on
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringi/).
stringi is THE R package for very fast, correct, consistent and
convenient string/text processing in each locale and any native character
encoding. The use of the [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org)
library gives R users a platform-independent set of functions known
to Java, Perl, Python, PHP, and Ruby programmers.
The package’s API was inspired by Hadley Wickham’s
[stringr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/) package.

The paper Gagolewski M., Mesiar R.,
*Monotone measures and universal integrals in a uniform framework for the scientific impact assessment problem*
has just been accepted for publication in *Information Sciences*
(doi:[10.1016/j.ins.2013.12.004](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2013.12.004)).


<blockquote><div>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> *The Choquet, Sugeno, and Shilkret integrals
with respect to monotone measures,
as well as their generalization
&ndash; the universal integral, stand for a useful tool in decision support systems.
In this paper we propose a general construction method for aggregation
operators that may be used in assessing output of scientists.
We show that the most often currently used indices of bibliometric impact,
like Hirsch's h, Woeginger's w, Egghe's g, Kosmulski's MAXPROD,
and similar constructions, may be obtained by means of our framework.
Moreover, the model easily leads to some new, very interesting functions.*

### stringi_0.1-9 Now Available

> 2013-08-20 #software



<p>*stringi* is THE R package for correct,
fast, and simple string processing in each locale and native charset.
Another alpha release (for testing purposes) can be automatically
downloaded by calling in R:</p>

source('http://stringi.rexamine.com/install.R') # Message from the future: the link is outdated

<p>
The auto-installer gives access to a Windows i386/x64 build for R 3.0
or allows building the package from sources on Linux or MacOS.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE@2013-11-13.</strong> Version 0.1-10 now available.
Includes some bugfixes. Moreover, on Linux/UNIX `./configure` now first
tries to read build settings from `pkg-config`
(as the usage of `icu-config` is deprecated).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE@2013-11-16.</strong> Version 0.1-11 now available.
ICU4C is now statically linked on Windows, so there is no need
to download any additional libraries &ndash; a binary version is
now available for R 2.15.X and 3.0.X. Moreover, on platforms where
packages are built from sources, the `./configure` script
now tries to find ICU4C automagically.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE@2013-11-21.</strong> Build of version 0.1-11 now available
for OS X (x64) and R 3.0. Have fun.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE@2014-02-15.</strong> Version 0.1-20 (source and Win_build only)
now available. Now it does not depend on any external ICU library
(the library source code is included).</p>

### "Scientific Impact Assessment Cannot Be Fair" Accepted for Publication

> 2013-07-02 #new paper



My paper "Scientific Impact Assessment Cannot Be Fair"
has just been accepted for publication in *Journal of Informetrics*.


Bibliography entry: <p> Gagolewski M.,
Scientific Impact Assessment Cannot be Fair,
*Journal of Informetrics* 7(4), 2013, pp. 792-802.</p>

<blockquote><div>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> *In this paper we deal with the problem of
aggregating numeric sequences of arbitrary length that represent e.g.
citation records of scientists. Impact functions are the aggregation
operators that express as a single number not only the quality of individual
publications, but also their author's productivity.<br />
We examine some fundamental properties of these aggregation tools.
It turns out that each impact function which always gives indisputable
valuations must necessarily be trivial. Moreover, it is shown that for
any set of citation records in which none is dominated by the other,
we may construct an impact function that gives any a priori-established
authors' ordering. Theoretically then, there is considerable room for
manipulation in the hands of decision makers.<br />
We also discuss the differences between the impact function-based
and the multicriteria decision making-based approach to scientific
quality management, and study how the introduction of new properties
of impact functions affects the assessment process. We argue that simple
mathematical tools like the h- or g-index (as well asother bibliometric
impact indices) may not necessarily be a good choice when it comes to
assess scientific achievements.*



### FuzzyNumbers-0.3-1 Released

> 2013-06-23 #software



A new version of the
[FuzzyNumbers](http://FuzzyNumbers.rexamine.com/)
package for R has just been submitted to the
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FuzzyNumbers/) archive.




** FuzzyNumbers Package CHANGELOG **

***************************************************************************

0.3-1 /2013-06-23/

* piecewiseLinearApproximation() - general case (any knot.n)
for method="NearestEuclidean" now available.
Thus, method="ApproximateNearestEuclidean" is now deprecated.

* New binary arithmetic operators, especially
for PiecewiseLinearFuzzyNumbers: +, -, *, /

* New method: fapply() - applies a function on a PLFN
using the extension principle

* New methods: as.character(); also used by show().
This function also allows to generate LaTeX code defining the FN
(toLaTeX arg thanks to Jan Caha).

* as.FuzzyNumber(), as.TriangularFuzzyNumber(), as.PowerFuzzyNumber(), and
as.PiecewiseLinearFuzzyNumber() are now S4 methods,
and can be called on objects of type numeric, as well as on
various FNs

* piecewiseLinearApproximation() and as.PiecewiseLinearFuzzyNumber()
argument `knot.alpha` now defaults to equally distributed knots
(via given `knot.n`). If `knot.n` is missing, then it is guessed
from `knot.alpha`.

* PiecewiseLinearFuzzyNumber() now accepts missing `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`,
and `knot.left`, `knot.right` of length `knot.n`+2. Moreover, if `knot.n`
is not given, then it is guessed from length(knot.left).
If `knot.alpha` is missing, then the knots will be equally distributed
on the interval [0,1].

* alphacut() now always returns a named two-column matrix.
evaluate() returns a named vector.

* New function: TriangularFuzzyNumber - returns a TrapezoidalFuzzyNumber.

* Function renamed: convert.side to convertSide, convert.alpha
to convertAlpha, approx.invert to approxInvert

* Added a call to setGeneric("plot", function(x, y, ...) ...
to avoid a warning on install

* The FuzzyNumbers Tutorial has been properly included
as the package's vignette

* DiscontinuousFuzzyNumber class has been marked as **EXPERIMENTAL**
in the manual

* Man pages extensively updated

* FuzzyNumbers devel repo moved to GitHub

<blockquote><div><strong>Abstract:</strong> *Recently, a very interesting
relation between symmetric minitive, maxitive, and modular aggregation
operators has been shown. It turns out that the intersection between any
pair of the mentioned classes is the same. This result introduces what we
here propose to call the OM3 operators. In the first part of our contribution
on the analysis of the OM3 operators we study some properties that may be useful
when aggregating input vectors of varying lengths. In Part II we will perform
a thorough simulation study of the impact of input vectors' calibration
on the aggregation results.*

<blockquote><div><strong>Abstract:</strong> *This article is a second part
of the contribution on the analysis of the recently-proposed class of symmetric
maxitive, minitive and modular aggregation operators. Recent results
(Gagolewski, Mesiar, 2012) indicated some unstable behavior of the
generalized h-index, which is a particular instance of OM3, in case
of input data transformation. The study was performed on a small,
carefully selected real-world data set. Here we conduct some experiments
to examine these phenomena more extensively.*
